This is an online shopping platform for a clothing shop. It was created with ReactJs using React Hooks and Context. This project is still in build and I am updating it day by day. I used firebase backend for storing collection data and Authentication. As I am learning a state management library called Redux and my plan is to update this web application using redux in recent future. Here are some features given below that I have added and some of them are in progress :

1. Homepage with different categories and navigation bar.
2. Collection page with some previews of total collections.
3. Firebase backend for storing data and authentication.
4. Authentication Page for log in and sign up.
5. User can log in with Email/Password and Google Sign In.
6. Checkout Page with cart items.
7. Small Cart Overlay for Cart preview.
8. Item increase and decrease feature in checkout page.
9. Locale feature with 2 diffrent languages. (In progress, will be completed soon)
10. Application is built using Singleton Design Pattern.
11. Application is built using React Hooks and React Context.
12. State management with Redux will be added (In Progress).
